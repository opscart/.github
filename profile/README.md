  # OpsCart
  
  ### **Kubernetes Automation, De-risked.**
  
  **We are not OpenCart.** We don't do e-commerce.  
  **We do production-grade Kubernetes tooling** — visual design, security auditing, and war-room diagnostics.

## 📦 Our Tools

We solve the **gap between intention and production** — the 30-minute firefights, the security holes your monitoring misses, and the YAML fatigue that slows every team.

| Tool | Description | Status | Try It |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| **🧭 Pilot** | **AI-powered Kubernetes visual designer.** Drag-and-drop architectures, get CIS security scores, estimate cloud costs, and generate production-ready YAML + Helm charts. | 🚀 **v1.0 Live** | [→ Repo](https://github.com/opscart/opscart-pilot) |
| **👀 Watchers** | **Production-grade Kubernetes security auditing.** Multi-cluster CIS compliance scanning, HTML executive reports, cost idle detection, and war-room diagnostics. Validated against `kubectl`. | 🔧 **v0.3** | [→ Repo](https://github.com/opscart/opscart-k8s-watcher) |

**More tools coming.** We build what broke our pager at 3 AM — so it doesn't break yours.

## 🎯 Why OpsCart Exists

I’ve spent 15 years in DevOps — the last 7 at GlobalLogic (Hitachi Group), handling **500+ core , Retail and pharmaceutical clusters** and enterprise-scale Kubernetes.

**The pattern is always the same:**
1. PowerPoint architecture looks perfect.
2. Production YAML is a mess of copy-paste.
3. Security says “You’re not CIS compliant.”
4. Finance says “Why is our cloud bill spiking?”
5. You spend 30 minutes finding *one* missing resource limit.

**So I built the tools I wished existed:**

- **Pilot** kills PowerPoint engineering. Design visually → get production code.
- **Watchers** kills the “Is this secure?” guessing game. Scan → get HTML reports → show your CISO.

**No dashboards. No SaaS lock-in. Just Go binaries and React components that run where you run.**
